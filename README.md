## About Me
I am an Information Systems (data science concentration) graduate student at Northeastern University, Toronto. I enjoy working with data, building data pipelines, and writing code. I possess hands-on experience in building and evaluating classification and regression models.

## Core Competencies
- Python, SQL (PostgreSQL, Oracle), NoSQL(MongoDB)
- AWS (Lambda, S3), GCP (Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery)
- Airflow, Docker, dbt
- Relational Database Design (with Data Normalization), Dimensional Modeling, Web Scraping
- Training and Evaluating Machine Learning Models (with Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, precision, recall, f1-score, accuracy) 
- Git, GitHub
- Jupyter Notebook, VSCode

## My Projects
[End-to-End Data Pipeline For An E-rerail Company's Customer Transaction Dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/data-pipeline-4-online-retail) [February 2024]

Engineered a data pipeline (using Airflow) that extracts data from Kaggle and prepares it, at the end of the pipeline, for creating a dashboard.

ML Project to investigate the performance of Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms for predicting customer churn in a credit card dataset.

[Exploration of Five Unsupervised Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/adedamola26/unsupervised-learning-algo-experiments) [April 2023]

Performed multiple experiments with k-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, PCA, ICA, and UMAP on two datasets

[A Supervised Machine Learning Approach to Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/adedamola26/creditCardFraudDetectionSystem) [March 2023]

Developed fraud detection models using Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms + a dataset containing 284,807 instances with 0.17% true positives

[Exploration of Five of the Most Used Supervised Learning Algorithms](https://github.com/adedamola26/supervised-learning-algo-experiments) [March 2023]

Investigated the performance of five cmmonly used supervised learning algorithms on two distinct datasets; the algorithms were: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and XGBoost
